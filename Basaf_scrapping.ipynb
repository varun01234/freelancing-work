      "Housefly lives in close association with man and is the most common species found throughout the world. They breed in decaying, fermenting or rotting organic matter. In Rural areas, breeding places are easily found around farms and houses in manure heaps and other places where organic matter has been dumped. In urban areas, rubbish heaps, wastes from food processing, sewage drains etc. are the sources of fly breeding. Flies are vector of many bacterial and viral diseases to man and animals. Continuous irritation by flies can result in lower weight, increase in immature animals, decreased production of milk and reduced egg yield in poultry. Furthermore, faecal and vomit spots will lower the quality of the eggs and cause serious financial loss. \n",
